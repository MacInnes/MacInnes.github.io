			  <h3>Projects:</h3>
			  <h4><a href="https://rpsai.herokuapp.com">RPSAI</a></h4>
			  <p>This project uses Node.js and MongoDB to create a Rock, Paper, Scissors game that attempts to learn from the player. The algorithm looks at the users' previous moves, and attempts to predict their next move.</p>
			  <h4><a href="https://crudassessment.herokuapp.com">Simple CRUD App</a></h4>
			  <p>This project was an assessment at Galvanize, requiring the use of Express (Node.js), MongoDB, as well as HTML and CSS to replicate a blog website.  Users can perform CRUD operations on articles. This project took roughly 4 hours to complete.</p>

			  <h3>About Me:</h3>
			  <p>My name is Andrew MacInnes Mockett, and I am a Full Stack Javascript Developer based in Boulder, CO.  I graduated from <a href="http://www.galvanize.com/courses/web-development/">Galvanize's Full Stack Developer</a> program, where I learned a surprising amount in a short period of time.  I knew that web development was something I could do, but I did not expect to enjoy it as much as I have.  I enjoy the mix between the logical problem solving and the creativity involved in design.</p>
			  <h3>Other interests:</h3>
			  <p>I'm a fan of being outdoors, so Colorado is the perfect place to live.  I spend all summer on my bike, and as much of winter as possible on my snowboard.  I've been teaching myself to play piano for the past 5 years - while challenging, it has changed the way I hear music.  </p>
